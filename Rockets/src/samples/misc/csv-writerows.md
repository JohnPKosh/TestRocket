Sure, I can help you with that. To write an array of different objects as CSV lines in Python, you can use the `csv` module¹ to create a writer object that can write delimited strings to a CSV file. The writer object has a method called `writerows` that takes an iterable of objects and writes each object as a row in the CSV file. The objects can be any type that can be converted to strings, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, or custom classes.

Here is an example of how to write an array of different objects as CSV lines in Python:

```python
# Import the csv module
import csv

# Define an array of different objects
array = [
  ["Alice", 25, "Engineer"], # A list
  ("Bob", 30, "Doctor"), # A tuple
  {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "occupation": "Teacher"}, # A dictionary
  SaleOrderDetail("SO-001", "David", 2460, "[tablet: $800 x 3 = $2400, mouse: $20 x 3 = $60]") # A custom class
]

# Open a CSV file in writing mode
with open("array.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
  # Create a writer object
  writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
  # Write the array of objects as CSV lines
  writer.writerows(array)
```

The output of this script is a CSV file named `array.csv` that looks like this:

```
Alice,25,Engineer
Bob,30,Doctor
name,age,occupation
Charlie,35,Teacher
SO-001,David,2460,[tablet: $800 x 3 = $2400, mouse: $20 x 3 = $60]
```
